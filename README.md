# DenaliHealthRPM

Denali Health RPM (remote patient monitoring) is a new product that will optimize healthcare from home.

This app will eventually be able to connect to various health devices, such as blood pressure monitors, EKGs, pulse oximeters, and many more. Then the data that is recorded will be monitored by our personnel.

The current scope of the project is as follows:

- connect to the two devices provided by AOJ Medical
- have the patient record their vitals via the devices
- take those recordings and store them in a database

To connect to these devices, AOJ Medical has provided us with an SDK. In further iteratons of the app, more devices and functionality will be added.
